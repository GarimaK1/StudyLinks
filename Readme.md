## Project Description

StudyLinks is a pure JavaScript application to store links of study material I want to pursue next.

Applied DOM manipulation techniques and JavaScript Object Oriented approach using ES6 classes

Data will be stored in LocalStorage. A new user won't have any data, so in the begining nothing will show in the table.

To use the app:

1) Add topic to study

2) Add link to study material - has to be a valid URL

3) Select the type of source from the dropdown list

[blog = Blog/Article, video = Youtube Video, official = Official Website]

4) Click on "Add Link". Your entry should be visible in table now.
